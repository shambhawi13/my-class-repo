#### Class Videos
[Back to top](#student-support)

Supplemental videos will be made available after lessons to help support your learning.
Class Videos will be posted in the `#class-videos` slack chanel. 



#### Tutoring
[Back to top](#student-support)

Tutoring Sessions will be made available to you if needed.

These sessions require that you have turned in homework and are in good standing with your attendance.

**How the system works:**

1) If you are interested in tutoring, you can find a chat window within BootcampSpot to request a tutor. You must also meet the attendance and homework requirements ( No more than 4 missed classes and no more than 2 missed homework assignments)

2) Once you have communicated your desire for a tutor through BootcampSpot the Student will receive an email with their assigned tutor 24-48 hours.Student will need to schedule their first session 24-48 hours after receiving email. 

Steps: 

**Step ONE** Log into BCS, on the main page click the support button on the nav bar.

 <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-01.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step TWO** From the drop down choose “I am a student” and “Tutor Request”. In the text box include topics you’d like support with along with your Github username. 

  <div style="text-align:center"><img src="assets/images/tutoring/tutor-step-02.jpg" alt="icon" width="400"></div>

**Step THREE** You will receive an email from Central Supports within 24-48 hours connecting you to your assigned tutor!




#### Tutoring Details
[Back to top](#student-support)

**Keep in mind any time zone differences. Please make sure to discuss it with your tutor.  This issue has created a few missed sessions in the past.**

**Sessions should be 60 minutes in length. Twice a week via a video using google hangouts.**

4) At the end of each session discuss scheduling the next session.  

5) Both the tutor and the student are **required** to fill out an evaluation form after EACH session.  Data is very important to the ongoing success of Central Support.  **Every tutor assignment email has the link to the Student’s Evaluation Form.**

* **If a student No-Shows to a session, the student may not be eligible for tutoring in the future.**

* **If student needs to change the appointment communicate with your tutor immediately.**

<hr>

#### Learning Assistant Support

What do Learning Assistants do?

> The Learning Assistant team is here to provide clarity in your learning journey. On the other end of every question you ask, is a Learning Assistant who is ready to help guide you in the right direction - even outside of standard classroom times!

> Students can expect to receive support from Learning Assistants in under 30 minutes. Each answer is unique, crafted from the information provided. Because of this, response times may vary.


How do I get support from Learning Assistants?

> In the #learning-assistant channel of your class’ Slack workspace, you can utilize a slash command ("/ask") to post an anonymous question to be answered by a Learning Assistant. This command will send your question to the team, where they will respond and guide you to finding your own answer.

Hours of Support

```
10a - 12a (local time) Monday - Thursday
10a - 10p (local time) Friday - Sunday
```

After Hours Support

> If you ask a question outside of support hours, it will not be answered until the start of the next support shift. We highly recommend waiting until support hours begin to ask your question.

How do Learning Assistants differ from Teaching Assistants?

> Teaching Assistants work to support a specific class or cohort. Learning Assistants, on the other hand, are a centralized team, working to support multiple classes and cohorts. Teaching Assistants are only available during scheduled instruction time while Learning Assistants are available during AND outside of class instruction time. 


Different types of questions we can support

##### Conceptual 

"What is the difference between HTML 4 and 5? Is it important to understand HTML 4 nowadays?"
Homework-Related 

"When the instructions say, "Do this/that thing", I am confused on how I might start that? I have started the assignment, here's what I have so far. Ideas for how to move forward?"

##### Activity or Lesson-Related 

"In class today, we completed the X-activity, and I messed up on creating an object. I tried to do Y-thing, and I'm not sure how to make it work. Here's a snippet of my code."
Troubleshooting  

"My code keeps throwing this error and I don't know why? [ insert snippet of code ] [ insert error message]"

##### General 

"I've been trying to practice more of X thing, and I would love to see an example of how this works. Could you support me in sharing one?"


Asking the right questions 

> Asking the right type of question is key to becoming a developer. It’s a skill you will utilize every day in all aspects of the job. Asking great questions will not only clarify misunderstandings, it will also allow the Learning Assistants to address additional issues or provide additional resources to you.

Great Questions  

>Great questions provide 3 points for the Learning Assistants to address, What, Why, and How.

```
What is my question?
Why am I asking this question?
How do I implement this concept/idea?
```
